# GHCP Proxy

Local compatibility proxy for Codex and Claude Code using GitHub Copilot.

## Read This First

The v2 Codex path uses GitHub's official Copilot SDK and bundled runtime. The
OpenAI Responses compatibility layer in this project is unofficial, as are the
legacy REST, Claude Code, and GPT Excel paths. You should still assume that
misuse can violate GitHub's terms or acceptable-use rules. GitHub's API terms
say abusive or excessive requests can lead to temporary or permanent suspension
of API access, and GitHub's acceptable-use rules include service usage limits.

Use your own account, respect GitHub's limits, and do not use this project to
evade billing or quotas. Rate limits make runaway usage less likely than it used
to be, but they are not permission to abuse the service. If you mark every
ordinary request as free/agent traffic or try to bypass billing accounting, you
are taking on account risk, including possible suspension or a permanent ban.

GitHub remains the source of truth for billing and enforcement:

- [GitHub Copilot usage limits](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/rate-limits)
- [GitHub API terms](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#h-api-terms)
- [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)

## Setup

You need Python 3.11 or newer, a GitHub account with Copilot access, and Codex
or Claude Code installed if you want GHCP Proxy to configure those clients.

From this folder, start the proxy:

```bash
python3 proxy.py
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3 .\proxy.py
```

Then open the dashboard:

```text
http://localhost:8000/
```

In the dashboard:

1. Sign in to GitHub if prompted.
2. Open **Integrations**.
3. Enable Codex, Claude Code, or both.
4. Install the shell commands.
5. Optionally enable startup so GHCP Proxy starts at login.
6. Restart any already-open Codex or Claude Code sessions.

That is the normal setup. You do not need Node.js, `npx`, or hand-edited
`~/.codex` / `~/.claude` config files.

## Codex v2 Upstream

Codex Responses requests use the official `github-copilot-sdk` package by
default. The SDK downloads and manages its matching Copilot runtime, owns the
GitHub-supported authentication/model transport, and persists its session state.
GHCP Proxy translates between OpenAI Responses items and SDK session events.

Client tools are registered as SDK declaration-only tools. When Copilot asks to
call one, the SDK suspends its turn; GHCP Proxy returns the call to Codex and
encodes the SDK session and request IDs in `call_id`. Codex executes the tool,
then its next Responses request resumes that exact SDK turn. Parallel calls are
batched and the encoded continuation survives proxy restarts.

Reasoning effort, including `max` for supported models, is forwarded to the SDK.
New caller instructions accompanying tool results are delivered as immediate
steering before those results release the next model call.

The SDK session stays connected across tool round-trips **and completed user
turns**. Destroying and resuming a session removes encrypted reasoning from
the SDK's persisted history, breaking the cached prefix on the next user turn.
Keeping the runtime alive also lets background compaction finish. Idle sessions
expire after `GHCP_SDK_SESSION_IDLE_SECONDS` (default 1800); at most 32 completed
idle sessions are retained, with the oldest evicted first. Pending tools and
active compaction are excluded from that capacity limit. When Codex compacts its
own transcript, the proxy keeps
the same SDK session -- the one that wrote the summary -- and only sends what
follows the summary, rather than replaying the summary into a fresh session.
If the model, effort, instructions, or tool configuration changes, the proxy
reconnects to the same SDK session with the updated options. Unchanged requests
continue using the existing connection.

An interrupted turn keeps its session too, once the runtime confirms the abort.

The runtime reaches Copilot over a WebSocket that chains `previous_response_id`
(Sol, and tool-using sessions generally), and Copilot caches along that chain:
a full-history request only reuses earlier *full* requests. The proxy's request
handler therefore keeps an idle upstream WebSocket when the runtime drops it and
hands it to the session's next connection; the full history a disk-resumed
session opens with is sent as a continuation of that chain when it matches it
item for item (`GHCP_SDK_WEBSOCKET_POOL_SECONDS`, default 600). If Copilot rejects
the continuation, the full request is sent instead. The handler also records
each session's encrypted reasoning (under `copilot-sdk/reasoning/`, pruned with
the session) and restores it into full-history requests that lost it, and gives
each session its own `prompt_cache_key` (disable with
`GHCP_SDK_PROMPT_CACHE_KEY=0`).

Request-finished traces include `copilot_sdk_session.operation` to distinguish
live reuse from disk resume, and `copilot_sdk_session.model_calls` for the
runtime's actual model calls: transport, whether each was a chained
continuation, restored reasoning, resumed chains, and (WebSocket) per-call
cached tokens. SDK request bodies in traces are adapter inputs, not the
model-wire requests. See
[the 2026-09-22 cache investigation](docs/prompt-cache-investigation-2026-09-22.md)
and [the 2026-09-21 investigation](docs/prompt-cache-investigation-2026-09-21.md)
for the evidence.

To temporarily restore the old direct REST implementation while diagnosing a
regression, start the proxy with:

```bash
GHCP_RESPONSES_UPSTREAM=rest python proxy.py
```

This switch applies to Codex Responses and model discovery. The legacy chat and
Anthropic compatibility routes continue to use their existing implementation.

## Token Pricing And Billing

GitHub Copilot usage-based billing prices input, cached-input, cache-write, and
output tokens according to the selected model, then converts the cost to GitHub
AI Credits (1 credit = $0.01 USD). GHCP Proxy applies the published per-token
rates to locally observed usage, but the dashboard remains an estimate. Your
GitHub account and billing pages are the source of truth.

For responsible use, leave prompts unprefixed most of the time and let the proxy
classify traffic. Use `_` only when you are deliberately continuing a tool-driven
agent workflow. Use `+` only when you are starting a fresh user request
immediately after prior proxy activity and want it counted as user traffic.

The dashboard shows recent requests, token counts, and estimated cost by token
type and provider. Treat that display as guidance, not a guarantee.

## First-Time Python Setup

If `python3 proxy.py` fails because packages are missing, create a local Python
environment once and install the dependencies:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python proxy.py
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\proxy.py
```

After the dashboard is working, use **Integrations** to install the convenient
start/stop commands:

- macOS zsh: `start-ghproxy` and `stop-ghproxy`
- Windows PowerShell: `Start-GHProxy` and `Stop-GHProxy`

## Daily Use

If startup is enabled, GHCP Proxy starts automatically when you sign in.

If you prefer manual control, use the installed command:

macOS:

```bash
start-ghproxy
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Start-GHProxy
```

The proxy listens only on your local machine:

```text
http://localhost:8000/v1
```

The dashboard is:

```text
http://localhost:8000/
```

## GPT Excel Upstream

`gpt-6-astra-excel`, `gpt-5.6-luna-excel`, `gpt-5.6-terra-excel`, and
`gpt-5.6-sol-excel` are
Responses-only models that send requests to the matching official ChatGPT
Excel add-in backend model instead of GitHub Copilot. They are experimental and
unofficial. The backend may change without notice, and using an add-in session
outside the add-in may be unsupported by OpenAI. Use only your own account and
session.

The Excel credential is deliberately separate from GitHub authentication. On
Windows it is encrypted with the current user's DPAPI key. On both Windows and
macOS it is read automatically from the Excel add-in cache at startup and
before Excel-routed requests when a fresh session is needed. The bearer token
and account ID are never returned to the dashboard.

Windows prerequisites:

- Excel desktop with the official ChatGPT add-in signed in at least once.

The Windows reader automatically reads the add-in's cached `bps_auth_tokens`
session from Office's WebView2 Local Storage database. It works while Excel is
closed; it never monitors network traffic, needs no DevTools port, and has no
dashboard toggle. If the session is missing, malformed, incomplete, or
expired, the dashboard reports that condition; open the signed-in add-in once
to refresh its cache, then retry the GPT Excel request.

Check non-secret status with:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/config/excel-session
```

### Reading from Excel for Mac

Excel for macOS stores the signed-in ChatGPT add-in session in WebKit
LocalStorage. GHCP Proxy reads that SQLite database directly; it does not
install a certificate or change macOS proxy settings.

Mac prerequisites:

- Excel desktop with the official ChatGPT add-in open and signed in.

GHCP Proxy loads the session automatically at startup and again whenever a
Excel-routed request finds no session or an expired token. There is no macOS
capture button or certificate/proxy setup.

The reader searches Excel's WebKit `WebsiteData/Default` profiles for the
`bps_auth_tokens` LocalStorage key. It extracts only the bearer token and
account identifiers required by GHCP Proxy and submits them to the loopback
session API. Token values are not printed or written to logs. The macOS session
remains memory-only, but GHCP Proxy reloads it after restarts. If the token
expires, refresh the ChatGPT Excel task pane so Excel writes a current token.
After priming, select `gpt-6-astra-excel`, `gpt-5.6-luna-excel`,
`gpt-5.6-terra-excel`, or `gpt-5.6-sol-excel` in Codex. Requests for all other
models still use GitHub
Copilot. Each Excel alias sends its matching base model on the wire and exposes
`low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh` reasoning efforts (`x-high` is accepted as
an input alias).

Basispoints rejects client-supplied tool schemas and injects its own
Excel-specific tools. GHCP Proxy therefore removes client tool declarations and
describes the caller's function and custom tools in a constrained catalog. To
make tool selection an actual function call instead of advisory text, the
bridge uses Basispoints' declared `run_officejs` function as a transport. The
proxy intercepts that call before execution, extracts the catalog tool request
from its `code` field, and never runs Office code or touches the workbook. Codex
receives a standard Responses `function_call` or `custom_tool_call` and executes
it locally under its normal approval policy. The result is replayed under the
original native call identity on the next request. The bridge intentionally
requests one client tool at a time; parallel client tool calls are not exposed
for Excel-routed models.

Replayed history keeps its native Responses shape: Basispoints accepts
`function_call` / `function_call_output` items for tools it never declared
(verified by live replays), and the model only maintains its tool state
machine when it sees the standard item shapes. Actual Basispoints calls,
including `update_plan` and the intercepted transport, retain the complete
native item across the client round trip. This includes the server item ID,
which Codex omits when it submits a tool result; a bounded in-memory call cache
restores that item exactly. The adapter also restores the native plan argument
schema after Codex consumes its normalized version and maps Codex's display-only
`Plan updated` result to the native executor's actual `{"status":"ok"}` result.
Finally, one `turn_id` is held constant throughout all tool iterations for a
user message, while only `agent_iteration` advances, matching the Excel
add-in's agent loop. Older versions changed `turn_id` after every tool result,
so Basispoints treated a completed plan as a new turn and planned again.
Preserving the native item and real turn boundary removes the loop without
steering text or a fabricated assistant turn. Text markers and their
`codex_client__` history namespace are accepted only to finish requests already
in flight during an upgrade.
Reasoning items with `encrypted_content` are replayed unchanged (GPT-5 models
repeat their previous action without that continuity); bare reasoning items
(which the stateless upstream would reject) are dropped.

The rewrite is deterministic and the prompt is laid out for the upstream
prompt cache: the instructions and the tool catalog lead, conversation history
follows, and only a short protocol reminder trails. The catalog originally sat
last, because A/B replays showed the model ignores the marker protocol when
nothing restates it near generation — but a trailing ~3.5k-token catalog caps
the cache prefix at its first byte and re-bills it on every single turn. Wire
captures showed a floor of roughly 3.8k fresh input tokens per request from
that alone; replaying those same captures through the current layout cuts
fresh input by about 60%. The compact trailing reminder keeps the recency the
model needs at a fraction of the cost. Set
`GHCP_EXCEL_CATALOG_AT_PROMPT_END=1` to restore the old suffix layout if the
reminder ever stops holding the model to the protocol.

Byte-for-byte determinism is the other half of the cache story: the same
client request must produce the same outbound bytes, or a retry looks like new
work. Two things used to break that. The proxy stamps Copilot's per-request
affinity headers (`x-request-id`, `x-github-request-id`, `x-agent-task-id`) on
outbound requests and strips them for Responses upstreams — but that check
matched the path `/responses` exactly, so the Excel gateway's
`/basispoints/api/responses` fell through to the Copilot branch and got a fresh
identifier on every request. The check now matches by suffix. Separately,
`task_id` is derived from the conversation identity and `turn_id` from the
conversation history through the latest user message. Tool results advance
`agent_iteration` without changing that turn identity, and a retried iteration
serializes identically.

Codex's `prompt_cache_key` is forwarded for cache routing (disable with
`GHCP_EXCEL_FORWARD_PROMPT_CACHE_KEY=0`), and the `task_id` metadata is derived
from it so one conversation keeps one task identity across turns.

Cost tracking prices each Excel alias at its matching GPT-5.6 token rates,
including applicable long-context tiers. The dashboard shows that spend in
OpenAI Credits ($0.04 = 1 Credit) instead of Copilot AIC; aggregate totals that
mix providers remain in AIC.

Clear the active session and, on Windows, its encrypted copy without stopping
the proxy:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Delete http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/config/excel-session
```

## Troubleshooting

Start here if setup does not work.

### Python Command Not Found

If `python3 --version` or `py -3 --version` fails, Python is not available in
that terminal. Install Python 3.11 or newer, then close and reopen the terminal.

On Windows, keep the Python launcher enabled during install. If `python` opens
the Microsoft Store instead of Python, use `py -3` commands.

### `venv` Creation Fails

Make sure you are using Python 3.11 or newer:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Some Linux distributions package virtual environment support separately. If
`python3 -m venv .venv` says `venv` is missing, install your distribution's
Python venv package, then run the command again.

### `No module named fastapi` Or `No module named uvicorn`

The dependencies were installed into a different Python than the one running
`proxy.py`. Use the local virtual environment for install and launch:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python proxy.py
```

### GitHub Auth Cannot Reach GitHub

If sign-in fails with a name-lookup, DNS, timeout, VPN, or firewall message,
first prove the terminal can reach GitHub:

```bash
curl -I https://github.com
```

If that fails, reconnect Wi-Fi or VPN and try again. If it works, start the
proxy again with `start-ghproxy` or `python3 proxy.py`.

Windows PowerShell without activation:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\proxy.py
```

### Dashboard Does Not Open

Check the terminal running `proxy.py`.

- If it is still running, open `http://localhost:8000/`.
- If it exited with an error, fix the error and start `proxy.py` again.
- If the browser says it cannot connect, the proxy is not running or another
  program is blocking port `8000`.

### Port 8000 Is Already In Use

GHCP Proxy uses `127.0.0.1:8000`. If startup says the address is already in use,
another copy is probably already running.

Close any old GHCP Proxy terminal windows, or use the dashboard/background
helper to stop the background copy if one was installed. Then start `proxy.py`
again.

### GitHub Sign-In Does Not Complete

Keep the dashboard open and follow the device-code flow exactly. Make sure you
sign in with the GitHub account that has Copilot access. After GitHub approves
the device code, return to the dashboard and wait for it to refresh.

### Codex Or Claude Code Still Uses Its Old Provider

After enabling a client from **Integrations**, fully restart any open Codex or
Claude Code sessions. These tools usually read their config only when a new
session starts.

If it still does not work, return to **Integrations**, disable the client,
enable it again, then start a fresh client session.

### Upstream Requests Time Out

Raise the upstream timeout before starting the proxy:

```bash
export GHCP_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
python proxy.py
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:GHCP_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = "300"
python .\proxy.py
```

`GHCP_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` applies to upstream non-streaming requests,
including `/v1/responses/compact`. The default is `300` seconds.

### Upstream Proxy Environment Variables

GHCP Proxy uses standard proxy variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`,
`NO_PROXY`) via `httpx` environment handling. It also accepts GHCP-specific
aliases and maps them to standard names at startup when needed:

- `GHCP_UPSTREAM_PROXY` (applies to both HTTP and HTTPS unless overridden)
- `GHCP_HTTPS_PROXY`
- `GHCP_HTTP_PROXY`
- `GHCP_NO_PROXY`

When a proxy is configured, GHCP Proxy now defaults to:

- `GHCP_UPSTREAM_TLS_VERIFY=0` (to tolerate enterprise TLS interception certs
  that are not in certifi by default)
- `GHCP_UPSTREAM_HTTP2=0` (to avoid proxy-specific HTTP/2 stream resets)

You can override either default explicitly:

- `GHCP_UPSTREAM_TLS_VERIFY=1` to require certificate validation
- `GHCP_UPSTREAM_HTTP2=1` to force HTTP/2 upstream requests

When background startup is enabled on macOS, the launch agent now records these
proxy-related environment variables so the background process can use the same
proxy route as interactive shell launches.

### Background Startup Gets Confusing

The first setup is easiest with a visible terminal running `proxy.py`. Install
startup only after the dashboard is working. If a background copy is already
installed, use **Integrations** or the installed helper commands to stop it
before starting a manual copy.

## What It Does

- Serves a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1`
- Proxies Codex Responses API traffic to GitHub Copilot
- Also works with Claude Code
- Installs Codex and Claude Code integrations from the local dashboard
- Supports GitHub Copilot auth from the local dashboard on first run
- Shows input, cached-input, cache-write, output-token, and estimated AI-credit cost data
- Tracks session, token, and estimated cost data from the proxy's own request log
- Saves recent request prompt transcripts for dashboard drill-downs; set
  `GHCP_REQUEST_PROMPT_ARCHIVE_DIR` to override that local archive location

## Auto Update

When GHCP Proxy is started from a git checkout, it checks the configured
upstream branch and updates itself when a safe upgrade is available. The proxy
restarts itself after a successful update.

After startup, the proxy keeps checking for safe updates every 15 minutes. If an
update is applied while upstream requests are active, the proxy
lets those requests finish before restarting. The dashboard shows when a restart
is pending or scheduled.

The updater is conservative:

- uses the checkout's existing upstream branch, such as `origin/main`
- runs `git fetch` and applies fast-forward updates when possible
- rebases committed local changes onto upstream when the checkout has diverged
- skips updates when the checkout is only ahead of upstream
- defaults to **user mode**, which stashes pending GHCP Proxy folder edits,
  updates, then reapplies those edits
- blocks the upgrade if pending changes cannot be safely reapplied, and the
  dashboard offers an explicit "Apply upgrade anyway" override that discards
  pending local changes before upgrading
- supports **developer mode**, which never stashes or discards local code
  changes during upgrades and instead blocks until you commit or remove them
- records the most recent result in the user state directory

Environment knobs:

```bash
export GHCP_AUTO_UPDATE=0                     # disable
export GHCP_AUTO_UPDATE_MODE=developer        # default: user
export GHCP_AUTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=900  # default: 15 minutes
export GHCP_AUTO_UPDATE_GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=60 # default git command timeout
```

## Integrations

Use the dashboard's **Integrations** page as the source of truth for local
setup. It can:

- connect Codex to GHCP Proxy
- connect Claude Code to GHCP Proxy
- install start/stop shell commands
- enable or disable startup at login
- restore the previous client configuration when an integration is disabled

The dashboard writes the required local config files and keeps backups before
replacing anything. Most users should not edit `~/.codex` or `~/.claude` by
hand.
